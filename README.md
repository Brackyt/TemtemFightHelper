**Temtem Fight Helper** is a **WIP** website to **help** you in your **temtem fights** !

## How does it work ?

1. <a href="https://brackyt.github.io/TemtemFightHelper/" target="_blank">Open the TFH website</a>
2. On the **left side** of the page **click** on any **"Click to select temtem"** to open the **temtem list to choose from**
3. A popup opens up, **scroll/search** and **click** on a temtem to **choose it**
4. **Repeat steps 2-3** to select **all the temtem** you have **in your in-game squad**
5. Do the **same thing** for the **right side** but with **temtem opposing you**
6. **Click** on **"Calculate"**
7. A **table** will **show under** with **which** of your **temtem** is **better to fight** the **opponents** ordered by strongest. **It shows** the **damage multiplier** you'll do on the enemy **depending** on the **attack type**.
8. You can repeat this process to change the temtem in your team and the ones currently fighting you

## What does the [WEAK] tag mean ?

When one of your temtem is **weak to** an **opponent's attack** it'll have a **[WEAK]** tag with a multiplier.
This is the **damage multiplier** the **enemy** will have when **attacking your temtem**.
